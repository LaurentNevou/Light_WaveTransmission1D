This program is computing the reflexion and transmission of a multi layer structure using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). It allows to get the field distribution inside the structure.

Four structures are proposed:

-> Bragg mirror

-> Fabry-Perot cavity

-> VCSEL structure

-> Anti-reflexion coating


=> If you like it, don't forget the star!
