% Comment: Why the TMM does not match perfectly to the formula?
%
% -> the reflectivity of the DBR is directly linked to the amount of period. This
% amount is different in both cases. Fixe in the formula while convolute with 
% both miror side in the TMM.
% -> The distance between the cavity mode are differents in both cases because in 
% the formula, the cavity length l3 is fixe while in the TMM, the cavity has an effective 
% length that is larger than l3 since the wave penetrate inside the DBR miror
